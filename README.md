## Discussion:
### The Differences in Cyberwarfare Attackers:

- Political activism and hacktivism: According to Gareeva, Krylova, and Khovrina(n.d.), hactivism is the new form of 
political activism. They are online activists who use "social media to spread the word and create a
movement and, what is more important for this work, there are hacktivists who seek to reshape politics".

- Industrial espionage: or also known as economic espionage, corporate spying, or corporate espionage. Is the action of
spying for commercial purpose only (not national security) (2)

- State-sponsored military cyberattacks: is the activity that target a nation and allied political, economic, military, 
educational, and critical infrastructure (CI) personnel and organizations to steal sensitive data, critical and emerging 
key technologies, intellectual property, and personally identifiable information (PII) (3)
