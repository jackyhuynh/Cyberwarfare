## Discussion:
### The Differences in Cyberwarfare Attackers:

- Political activism and hacktivism: According to Gareeva, Krylova, and Khovrina(n.d.), hactivism is the new form of 
political activism. They are online activists who use "social media to spread the word and create a
movement and, what is more important for this work, there are hacktivists who seek to reshape politics".

- Industrial espionage: or also known as economic espionage, corporate spying, or corporate espionage. Is the action of
spying for commercial purpose only (not national security) (2)

- State-sponsored military cyberattacks: is the activity that target a nation and allied political, economic, military, 
educational, and critical infrastructure (CI) personnel and organizations to steal sensitive data, critical and emerging 
key technologies, intellectual property, and personally identifiable information (PII) (3)

### Threat answer to Akash on Cyberwarfare

Hi Akash! This is Truc. I have to tell you, there is no coding in this class my friend. However, the material is extremely 
awesome (I read 3 chapters in the book by far). Sometimes this knowledge (to design and prevent) is way more important than 
the ability to code. If you like coding I can suggest an ethical hacking and pen testing course that you can buy at Udemy. 
They cover many aspects of hacking in coding style (Python, networking, mapping, infrastructure): Learn Python & Ethical 
Hacking From Scratch | Udemy. If you want to implement security coding in software development there are Secure Coding
Guidelines (you may want to do your own research toward reliable source IEEE for example). ISO 9000-3: Quality management 
and quality assurance standards, https://www.iso.org/standard/26364.html. This is also a good book for your purpose. 
If you like them let me know.

### Armed Conflict:
How Cryptology Affect the Outcome of World War II
Cryptology and information protection had been used for many years. In Ancient Warfare, Julius Caesar of the Roman Empire use the Caesar Cipher to protect his message to his general (1). Today, information protection has been widely using not only for military purposes and government but also in the private sector such as financial banking, data privacy, and daily communications. All Information is well protected these days. In my opinion, the most achievement that cryptology is the decoding of the Engima system that help the Allied win World War II. 

#### What is the Enigma System
Enigma System is an encryption communication machine that was designed by the Germans and Japan to help them protect their military’s information transformation.

Why Enigma? The fastest way to communicate is by using the signal that travels through the air. Communication transfer from point A to point B over the air was considered the most convenient and fastest way due to the flexibility in location (1). There was no cable to connect from Japan to Germany at that time, so I assume they use radio stations and towers to transfer information. Therefore, Enigma was designed.

How do Enigma’s functionality and design? According to (1), Enigma resembles a typewriter and works in the following steps:
- Encoding:
  - Set the machine to the code of the device
  - Key in the letter of the message by letter
  - Each letter that lights up on the machine while typing will be sent out as part of the encrypted messages
- Decoding:
  - Press the key corresponding to the letters in the encrypted message.
  - The letter of the original message will light up on the Enigma machine

#### The Bombe system
According to Chapple, M., & Seidl, D. (2023), the Bombe System was developed from the Ultra Project (led by British mathematicians Alan Turning). It was a very large, special purpose computer. Bombe's main duty is to break the Enigma code. After many years of development, the Bombe was able to decode the communications from the Enigma machine. Thus, the Allied war planners gained great insight into German Operations, and the entire German communication system fell into the Allied hands. Therefore, the development of Bombe is the turning point to winning the war and saving the lives of billions of people.

## How do you think the resources, capabilities/techniques, motivations, and aversion to risk differ between political activists and state-sponsored military cyber attackers?

Political Activists (PA) v.s. State-sponsored Military cyber attackers (SMCA)
- Resources: 	
  - (PA) Limited Resources depend on the size of the organization (Ex: individuals may end up using free tools on  the internet)	
  - Unlimited resources due to the sponsor from the government (limit only on that government's budget). 

- Capabilities/ Techniques:
  - Use the same tools and techniques as state-sponsored Military cyber attackers.	
  - Advanced techniques as state-sponsored Military cyber attackers.
    
- Motivations:
  - Involve in the political process that seeks to change the options or effect political change through peaceful, nonviolent means (1)	
  - Aim to destroy or create as much damage as possible (attack cyberinfrastructure, cut power, control network, and so much more) to the opposing force: violent means

- Techniques	
  - Use the same techniques as state-sponsored Military cyber attackers.	
  - According to (1), most techniques were outlined in the Information Operations Roadmap developed by DoD:
    - Computer Network Attack, 
    - Computer Network Defense, 
    - Intelligence Gathering, 
    - Electronic Warfare, 
    - Psychological Operation, 
    - Military deception, and 
    - Operations Security

## Information Operations Roadmap
    
Information Operation Roadmap was developed by the Department of Defense. The roadmap organized information operations to help 
the military better organizes, train, and equip wage information operation in the future:
### Computer Network Attack (CNA):
  - Core capabilities of offensive information operation
  - The Use of the computer network to: disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy an adversary's information or information systems
  - CNA weapons can exploit vulnerabilities in the computer system and network - vulnerabilities unknown to the outside world (zero-day vulnerabilities)
  - Retrieved from (1)
### Computer Network Defense  (CND):
  - Activities designed to protect, monitor, analyze, detect, and respond to CNA weapons in a friendly information system or network
  - Tools and talent are exchanged between the military and private sectors.
  - Retrieved from (1)
### Intelligence Gathering:
  - Efforts to gather information about an adversary’s capabilities, plans, and actions
  - Obtain as much information about the opponent as possible (cyberespionage)
  - Retrieved from (1)
### Electronic Warfare:
  - Military actions designed to use electromagnetic or directed energy to control the electromagnetic spectrum or attack the enemy
  - weapon varieties are wide:
    - (land) ground stations
    - (air) specialized aircraft
    - (sea) ships at sea
  - There are 3 subdivisions:
    - Electronic attack: the use of electromagnetic or directed energy to attack personnel, facilities, or equipment
    - Electronic protection: protect our personal, facilities, or equipment from Electronic warfare
    - Electronic warfare support: actions(search, analyst) that support Electronic Attack, Electronic Protect.
    - Retrieved from (1)
    
### Psychological Operation (PSYOPs):
- Military operations planned to convey selected information and indicators to foreign governments, organizations, groups, and
individuals to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and behavior
- There are five roles for PSYOPs:
  - Influence foreign populations by sharing information subjectively
  - Attack the enemy's will to resist and minimizes the adverse impacts on psychological targets
  - Provide public information to foreign populations to support humanitarian activities, and restore or reinforce the legitimacy
  - Convey intent and establish credibility with foreign populations
  - Counteract enemy propaganda
  - Retrieved from (1)

### Military deception:
- Actions designed to mislead adversary forces about the operational capabilities, plans, and actions of friendly force
- Usually occur at the strategic level to attempt to mislead foreign leaders
- Retrieved from (1)

### Operations Security (OPSEC):
- Activities designed to deny an adversary access to information about friendly forces that would reveal capabilities, plans, or actions
- Designed against the enemy's information gathering:
- Retrieved from (1)
- There are five steps in OPSEC:
  - Identification of critical information:
    Identify essential information elements that would be valuable to the enemy and cause harm if disclosed
  - Threat Analyst: 
    Answer six fundamental questions to identify, who are the threats
  - Vulnerability Analyst:
    Examine all the possible ways that adversaries could gather information from the operations
  - Risk Assessment
    Analyze vulnerabilities identified during the vulnerability assessment and identify
  possible OPSEC countermeasures for each. Estimate the cost of implementing each OPSEC countermeasure and make final countermeasures for execution
  - Countermeasure Implementation
    Implement the plan in a secure way (four criteria)
