## Discussion:
### The Differences in Cyberwarfare Attackers:

- Political activism and hacktivism: According to Gareeva, Krylova, and Khovrina(n.d.), hactivism is the new form of 
political activism. They are online activists who use "social media to spread the word and create a
movement and, what is more important for this work, there are hacktivists who seek to reshape politics".

- Industrial espionage: or also known as economic espionage, corporate spying, or corporate espionage. Is the action of
spying for commercial purpose only (not national security) (2)

- State-sponsored military cyberattacks: is the activity that target a nation and allied political, economic, military, 
educational, and critical infrastructure (CI) personnel and organizations to steal sensitive data, critical and emerging 
key technologies, intellectual property, and personally identifiable information (PII) (3)

### Threat answer to Akash on Cyberwarfare

Hi Akash! This is Truc. I have to tell you, there is no coding in this class my friend. However, the material is extremely 
awesome (I read 3 chapters in the book by far). Sometimes this knowledge (to design and prevent) is way more important than 
the ability to code. If you like coding I can suggest an ethical hacking and pen testing course that you can buy at Udemy. 
They cover many aspects of hacking in coding style (Python, networking, mapping, infrastructure): Learn Python & Ethical 
Hacking From Scratch | Udemy. If you want to implement security coding in software development there are Secure Coding
Guidelines (you may want to do your own research toward reliable source IEEE for example). ISO 9000-3: Quality management 
and quality assurance standards, https://www.iso.org/standard/26364.html. This is also a good book for your purpose. 
If you like them let me know.

### Armed Conflict:
How Cryptology Affect the Outcome of World War II
Cryptology and information protection had been used for many years. In Ancient Warfare, Julius Caesar of the Roman Empire use the Caesar Cipher to protect his message to his general (1). Today, information protection has been widely using not only for military purposes and government but also in the private sector such as financial banking, data privacy, and daily communications. All Information is well protected these days. In my opinion, the most achievement that cryptology is the decoding of the Engima system that help the Allied win World War II. 

#### What is the Enigma System
Enigma System is an encryption communication machine that was designed by the Germans and Japan to help them protect their military’s information transformation.

Why Enigma? The fastest way to communicate is by using the signal that travels through the air. Communication transfer from point A to point B over the air was considered the most convenient and fastest way due to the flexibility in location (1). There was no cable to connect from Japan to Germany at that time, so I assume they use radio stations and towers to transfer information. Therefore, Enigma was designed.

How do Enigma’s functionality and design? According to (1), Enigma resembles a typewriter and works in the following steps:
- Encoding:
  - Set the machine to the code of the device
  - Key in the letter of the message by letter
  - Each letter that lights up on the machine while typing will be sent out as part of the encrypted messages
- Decoding:
  - Press the key corresponding to the letters in the encrypted message.
  - The letter of the original message will light up on the Enigma machine

#### The Bombe system
According to Chapple, M., & Seidl, D. (2023), the Bombe System was developed from the Ultra Project (led by British mathematicians Alan Turning). It was a very large, special purpose computer. Bombe's main duty is to break the Enigma code. After many years of development, the Bombe was able to decode the communications from the Enigma machine. Thus, the Allied war planners gained great insight into German Operations, and the entire German communication system fell into the Allied hands. Therefore, the development of Bombe is the turning point to winning the war and saving the lives of billions of people.
