## Discussion:
### The Differences in Cyberwarfare Attackers:

- Political activism and hacktivism: According to Gareeva, Krylova, and Khovrina(n.d.), hactivism is the new form of 
political activism. They are online activists who use "social media to spread the word and create a
movement and, what is more important for this work, there are hacktivists who seek to reshape politics".

- Industrial espionage: or also known as economic espionage, corporate spying, or corporate espionage. Is the action of
spying for commercial purpose only (not national security) (2)

- State-sponsored military cyberattacks: is the activity that target a nation and allied political, economic, military, 
educational, and critical infrastructure (CI) personnel and organizations to steal sensitive data, critical and emerging 
key technologies, intellectual property, and personally identifiable information (PII) (3)

### Threat answer to Akash on Cyberwarfare

Hi Akash! This is Truc. I have to tell you, there is no coding in this class my friend. However, the material is extremely 
awesome (I read 3 chapters in the book by far). Sometimes this knowledge (to design and prevent) is way more important than 
the ability to code. If you like coding I can suggest an ethical hacking and pen testing course that you can buy at Udemy. 
They cover many aspects of hacking in coding style (Python, networking, mapping, infrastructure): Learn Python & Ethical 
Hacking From Scratch | Udemy. If you want to implement security coding in software development there are Secure Coding
Guidelines (you may want to do your own research toward reliable source IEEE for example). ISO 9000-3: Quality management 
and quality assurance standards, https://www.iso.org/standard/26364.html. This is also a good book for your purpose. 
If you like them let me know.

### Armed Conflict:
How Cryptology Affect the Outcome of World War II
Cryptology and information protection had been used for many years. In Ancient Warfare, Julius Caesar of the Roman Empire use the Caesar Cipher to protect his message to his general (1). Today, information protection has been widely using not only for military purposes and government but also in the private sector such as financial banking, data privacy, and daily communications. All Information is well protected these days. In my opinion, the most achievement that cryptology is the decoding of the Engima system that help the Allied win World War II. 

#### What is the Enigma System
Enigma System is an encryption communication machine that was designed by the Germans and Japan to help them protect their military’s information transformation.

Why Enigma? The fastest way to communicate is by using the signal that travels through the air. Communication transfer from point A to point B over the air was considered the most convenient and fastest way due to the flexibility in location (1). There was no cable to connect from Japan to Germany at that time, so I assume they use radio stations and towers to transfer information. Therefore, Enigma was designed.

How do Enigma’s functionality and design? According to (1), Enigma resembles a typewriter and works in the following steps:
- Encoding:
  - Set the machine to the code of the device
  - Key in the letter of the message by letter
  - Each letter that lights up on the machine while typing will be sent out as part of the encrypted messages
- Decoding:
  - Press the key corresponding to the letters in the encrypted message.
  - The letter of the original message will light up on the Enigma machine

#### The Bombe system
According to Chapple, M., & Seidl, D. (2023), the Bombe System was developed from the Ultra Project (led by British mathematicians Alan Turning). It was a very large, special purpose computer. Bombe's main duty is to break the Enigma code. After many years of development, the Bombe was able to decode the communications from the Enigma machine. Thus, the Allied war planners gained great insight into German Operations, and the entire German communication system fell into the Allied hands. Therefore, the development of Bombe is the turning point to winning the war and saving the lives of billions of people.

## How do you think the resources, capabilities/techniques, motivations, and aversion to risk differ between political activists and state-sponsored military cyber attackers?

Political Activists (PA) v.s. State-sponsored Military cyber attackers (SMCA)

### Network Defense in Depth: 
Effective defenses for networks typically require multiple layers of technologies, processes, procedures, awareness, and training, which operate in layers to provide defense in depth. 
Network defense in depth must focus on attacks from:
- Outside a network
- Trusted systems allowed to connect to the network or which may be compromised and then used to attack the network from the inside
- Coworkers or trusted network or system administrators
Layered defenses in a network design allow defenders to deal with a breach more effectively by using additional defenses to prevent the attack from making further progress. It allows them to detect the attack and react appropriately. Layered defenses are an expected part of almost any network design. Click on each topic to learn more.

### The major types of networks
Cyberwarfare defenders must consider many types of networks when they design defenses. Among those networks, there are four major types that are commonly found in many organizations:
- Local area networks (LANs)—Defenders typically can control LANs relatively effectively, allowing them to choose technologies, implementation, practices, and policies that best suit the needs of their organizations.
- Wide area networks (WANs)—WANS are between local networks. They often use third-party service providers to interconnect local networks, resulting in risks based on the abilities of those service providers to ensure reliable, secure service.
- The Internet—This is a decentralized, open network that is not designed to be inherently secure. It is a network of networks, and provides both an immense variety of options for organizations that want to communicate and just as many possibilities for attack.
- Proprietary networks—These networks are based on specialized technologies or have some other distinguishing factor that makes them separate from other, more traditional networks.

### The Protect, Detect, React paradigm

The U.S. government provides many of the most accessible strategy and implementation documents available describing computer network defense. The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) publishes documents that are broadly adopted by organizations worldwide.

The technology portion of the NSA’s People/Technology/Operations defense-in-depth strategy relies on a Protect, Defend, React paradigm. This requires the network to include protective mechanisms and abilities, as well as capabilities, processes, and technologies that can detect attacks.

This assumption that attacks will occur and that they may succeed then drives the need for the ability to react. Thus, the NSA’s requirement for defense in depth includes the ability to handle attacks and breaches, and not only to respond appropriately, but also to recover after the breach.

The technology for the NSA’s defense-in-depth strategy, shown in the figure, focuses on network and infrastructure protection in three major areas:

- Protection of LANs and WANs against attacks like denial of service (DoS) attacks that attempt to prevent use of networks and systems on networks
- The requirement to protect both confidentiality and integrity, which ensures that data is not exposed and has not been modified when transmitted over networks
- The use of enclave boundaries or network segment protection by means of firewalls and intrusion detection systems to both limit traffic and detect attacks

The way that people are trained as well as the policies, standards, and processes they use all have an important role in the NSA’s strategy—as do the operational elements such as log monitoring, certification, and day-to-day management. In fact, every part of the NSA’s strategy is critical to an information assurance program.

### Mission Assurance

In addition to the NSA’s Protect, Defend, React paradigm, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) uses a concept known as mission assurance as a key part of its defense-in-depth strategy. In short, mission assurance in cyberwarfare operations is the process by which systems and networks are kept online and functioning. DoD helps to ensure this by using a risk management process that assesses the functional requirements of networks and systems then matches appropriate methods of control to them to ensure that the risks they face will not disrupt them.

DoD has developed its mission assurance strategy over time, and in March 2014, it adopted a new standard as part of its overall information assurance strategy. The Risk Management Framework for DoD Information Technology is designed to provide mission assurance, and is aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF). The policy under which the RMF was adopted states that DoD will use enterprise-wide decision-making processes for cybersecurity risk management based on NIST standards and guidance.

- Mission Assurance Categories (MAC)
- The NIST risk management process
- Surviving attacks
- Network operational procedures

### Mission Assurance Categories (MAC)

DoD uses three mission assurance levels, known as Mission Assurance Categories (MAC):

- MAC I is composed of systems that are critical to the completion of DoD’s mission, and which therefore must have the highest possible level of integrity and availability, as well as extremely strong security controls.
- MAC II includes systems that support deployed and backup forces. Although not as critical as MAC I, MAC II systems could have a significant impact on DoD’s ability to complete its mission. Loss of availability is only allowable for very short time periods, whereas loss of integrity through the modification of data is not acceptable for MAC II systems. DoD notes that MAC II–level systems must exceed common industry practices for security to provide high levels of integrity and availability.
- MAC III includes systems that are used for normal operations but are not used for operational support of deployed units or for mission-critical operations. Thus, although MAC III systems are important, the exposure or modification of data on MAC III systems, or issues with their availability, could be dealt with in a reasonable way. MAC III systems are expected to use common industry standards for security to provide integrity and availability assurance.

### The NIST risk management process

The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF) provides a process for assessing risk to systems and data, then selecting, implementing, using, and monitoring appropriate controls. The figure shows the NIST RMF process flow for risk assessment. In computer network defense operations, the categorization process typically includes assessments of the classification of data and systems, as well as the mission assurance requirements of the systems and networks involved. Categorization also typically looks at relevant laws, standards, and strategic requirements, as well as what resources are available. NIST provides guidance on classification of systems for U.S. government agencies as part of FIPS 199, a standard written in 2004 for security categorization of federal information and information systems.

DoD’s relatively quick changes in risk management and information assurance strategies demonstrate the pace at which defensive strategies and technologies have changed since DoD’s Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) was first adopted under the NSA’s guidance. The level of reliance on computer networks, as well as their role in cyberwarfare and traditional kinetic warfare, has greatly increased in the seven years since DIACAP was fully approved, creating an ongoing need to update and replace existing standards. In addition to the changes made necessary by new technologies and threats, the move to DoD RMF for information technology (IT) also better aligns the department with other U.S. government agencies that have adopted the NIST Risk Management Framework for their own use. This allows shared training, easier auditing, and other advantages based on a shared knowledge base for military personnel and civilian contractors

### Surviving attacks

The need for mission assurance and the ability to react mean that surviving network attacks is an important part of defending networks in cyberwar. Networks must be both resilient and adaptable to changing network conditions—like those found in large-scale denial of service attacks conducted from thousands of systems around the world—and yet still must be able to handle an attack that targets their component parts.

Providing a resilient network often combines a series of design elements that can include capabilities such as:
- Diverse geographic locations for major network components to make sure that natural disasters or direct enemy action cannot disable the entire network.
- Multiple service providers if commercial services are used to provide network connectivity.
- Careful analysis of the paths network traffic takes, to ensure that a single event can’t disable multiple paths at one time.
- Selection of hardware and software to handle attacks that create excessive traffic or are aimed at a specific hardware or software version. This can require multiple brands or types of devices, as well as different testing than a typical commodity device might undergo.
- Certification and configuration testing to ensure that the device has been tested for security and design flaws. This doesn’t prevent the flaws, but can help ensure that the devices are more secure by default.
- Use of commercial services that specialize in defense against network attacks like distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. These services use very high-bandwidth systems distributed closer to end users to ensure that an attack against a single location or data center cannot prevent the service from continuing to be available to most users.

Surviving network attacks requires both careful design and the ability to respond quickly and intelligently to attacks that do succeed. Restoring services must be carefully balanced with understanding what attackers did, and what the best route to recovering may be.

### Network operational procedures

The procedures and processes used to operate a secure network are part of the human layers of protection that go into a well-designed defense-in-depth network defense strategy. The following procedures must be in place:
- Network device management, updates, and configuration must ensure that the devices making up the network are properly patched, do not use default passwords or vulnerable configurations, and that the configurations are backed up and consistent. In addition, the way that devices are managed can help to ensure that a trusted attacker cannot modify the device to breach the organization’s security, and that attackers can’t use a trusted system to make changes without those changes being noticed. This is done via automated configuration and validation tools or systems.
- Response processes for both breaches and vulnerabilities are needed to ensure that issues are dealt with promptly and fully. Internal disclosure and communication can help to minimize an issue’s effect, whereas incorrect or incomplete information or lack of a process can lead to the problem becoming even more of an issue.
- Network entry and access management can help ensure that devices are trusted and secure. The ways in which devices are added to a network and the methods used to verify that systems or devices are allowed to connect are particularly important in a high-security environment. In DoD’s compartmentalization systems, a system that is not rated for Top Secret data should not be allowed into a Top Secret network. Ensuring that a system cannot just plug into a network jack or connect to a wireless network that isn’t compatible with its sensitivity rating helps to protect both the data and the network.
- Device acquisition policies and procedures are increasingly important in computer network defense. The manufacturer of devices, the code and hardware that are part of the devices, and even the shipping process they go through can be important to the security of a device.

The fear that nation-state-level organizations have influenced or modified the hardware and software of network devices has been a repeated news topic in recent years. Reports in 2012 noted that 9,539 banned businesses had sold technology to the U.S. government, and that about 10 percent of those incidents involved counterfeit parts or gear.

The information released in 2014 by Edward Snowden included pictures purporting to show routers that were diverted to facilities used by the NSA, where additional software was allegedly loaded onto the routers. The code reportedly included “phone home” capabilities, which would activate once the routers were added to a live network. Such activities can lead to devices being compromised even before they are delivered.

Many operational processes and policies are needed for a strong, secure network. A complete defense-in-depth design must first identify what may be needed, and then must prioritize which processes are most important without leaving gaps attackers can exploit.

# Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:

A “denial of service” or DoS attack is used to tie up a website’s resources so that users who need to access the site cannot do so. The attacks have hit many major companies. And the bad news? Because a DoS attack can be launched from nearly any location, finding those responsible for them can be difficult.

Here’s are some answers to frequently asked questions about these attacks, how they work, and how you can protect yourself from them.

## How long have DoS attacks been a threat?
A 13-year-old, David Dennis, can claim credit for the first DoS attack in 1974. Dennis  wrote a program using the “external” or “ext” command that forced computers at a  nearby university research lab to power off. 

DoS attacks have since evolved into the more complex and sophisticated “distributed denial of service” (DDoS) attacks that are common today. The biggest attack ever recorded — at that time — targeted code-hosting-service GitHub in 2018.

## Who is usually behind DoS attacks?
Attackers typically include hacktivists, hackers whose activity is aimed at promoting a social or political cause; profit-motivated cybercriminals and nation states.

## What are flooding DoS attacks?
DoS attacks generally take one of two forms. They either flood web services or crash them.

Flooding attacks are the more common form. These occur when the attacked system is overwhelmed by large amounts of traffic that the server is unable to handle. The system eventually stops.

An ICMP flood — also known as a ping flood — is a type of DoS attack that sends spoofed packets of information that hit every computer in a targeted networ ,
taking advantage of misconfigured network devices.

A SYN flood is a variation that exploits a vulnerability in the TCP connection sequence.  This is often referred to as the three-way handshake connection with the host and the  server. Here’s how it works:

The targeted server receives a request to begin the handshake. But, in a SYN flood, the handshake is never completed. That leaves the connected port as occupied and unavailable to process further requests. Meanwhile, the cybercriminal continues to send more and more requests, overwhelming all open ports and shutting down the server.

What are crash DoS attacks?
Crash attacks occur less often when cybercriminals transmit bugs that exploit flaws in the targeted system. The result? The system crashes.

Crash attacks — and flooding attacks — prevent legitimate users from accessing online services such as websites, gaming sites, email, and bank accounts.

## How do DoS attacks work?
Unlike a virus or malware, a DoS attack doesn’t depend on a special program to run. Instead, it takes advantage of an inherent vulnerability in the way computer networks communicate.

Suppose you wish to visit an e-commerce site to shop for a gift. Your computer sends a small packet of information to the website. The packet works as a “hello.” Basically, your computer says, “Hi. I’d like to visit you. Please let me in.”

When the server receives your computer’s message, it sends a short one back, saying in a sense, “OK. Are you real?” Your computer responds — “Yes!” — and communication is established.

The website’s homepage then pops up on your screen, and you can explore the site. Your computer and the server continue communicating as you click links, place orders, and carry out other business.

In a DoS attack, a computer is rigged to send not just one “introduction” to a server, but hundreds or thousands. The server — which cannot tell that the introductions are fake — sends back its usual response, waiting up to a minute in each case to hear a reply. When it gets no reply, the server shuts down the connection, and the computer executing the attack repeats, sending a new batch of fake requests.

DoS attacks mostly affect organizations and how they run in a connected world. For consumers, the attacks hinder their ability to access services and information.

## What is a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack?
Distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attacks are the next step in the evolution of DoS attacks. Cybercriminals began using DDoS attacks around 2000.

These attacks use large numbers of compromised computers, as well as other electronic devices — such as webcams and smart televisions that make up the ever- increasing Internet of Things — to force the shutdown of the targeted website, server or network.

Security vulnerabilities in Internet-of-Things devices can make them accessible to cybercriminals seeking to anonymously and easily launch DDoS attacks.

In contrast, a DoS attack generally uses a single computer and a single IP address to attack its target, making it easier to defend against.

## How can I prevent DoS attacks?
A general rule: The earlier you can identify an attack-in-progress, the quicker you can contain the damage. Here are some things you can do to protect yourself from this threat.

### Method 1: Get help recognizing attacks
Companies often use technology or anti-DDoS services to help defend themselves. These can help you recognize between legitimate spikes in network traffic and a DDoS attack.

### Method 2: Contact your internet service provider
If you find your company is under attack, you should notify your Internet Service Provider as soon as possible to determine if your traffic can be rerouted. Having a backup ISP is a good idea, too. Also, consider services that can disperse the massive DDoS traffic among a network of servers. That can help render an attack ineffective.

### Method 3: Investigate black hole routing
Internet service providers can use “black hole routing.” It directs excessive traffic into a null route, sometimes referred to as a black hole. This can help prevent the targeted website or network from crashing. The drawback is that both legitimate and illegitimate traffic is rerouted in the same way.

### Method 4: Configure firewalls and routers
Firewalls and routers should be configured to reject bogus traffic. Remember to keep your routers and firewalls updated with the latest security patches.

### Method 5: Consider front-end hardware
Application front-end hardware that’s integrated into the network before traffic reaches a server can help analyze and screen data packets. The hardware classifies the data as priority, regular, or dangerous as they enter a system. It can also help block threatening data.

### What steps can I take if I’m a smaller business to prevent DoS attacks?
If you operate on a smaller scale — say, you operate a basic website offering a service — your chances of becoming a victim of a DDoS attack are low. Even so, taking certain precautions will help protect you against becoming a victim of any type of attack by hackers.

### Here are a few things that can help.

Keep your security software, operating system, and applications updated. Security updates help patch vulnerabilities that hackers might try to exploit.
Consider a trusted security software like Norton Security.
Consider a router that comes with built-in DDoS protection. Look for a website hosting service with an emphasis on security.
Taking simple precautions can make a difference when it comes to your online security. For large organizations, the precautions become far more complex.
