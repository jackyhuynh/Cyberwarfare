## Discussion:
### The Differences in Cyberwarfare Attackers:

- Political activism and hacktivism: According to Gareeva, Krylova, and Khovrina(n.d.), hactivism is the new form of 
political activism. They are online activists who use "social media to spread the word and create a
movement and, what is more important for this work, there are hacktivists who seek to reshape politics".

- Industrial espionage: or also known as economic espionage, corporate spying, or corporate espionage. Is the action of
spying for commercial purpose only (not national security) (2)

- State-sponsored military cyberattacks: is the activity that target a nation and allied political, economic, military, 
educational, and critical infrastructure (CI) personnel and organizations to steal sensitive data, critical and emerging 
key technologies, intellectual property, and personally identifiable information (PII) (3)

### Threat answer to 

Hi Akash! This is Truc. I have to tell you, there is no coding in this class my friend. However, the material is extremely 
awesome (I read 3 chapters in the book by far). Sometimes this knowledge (to design and prevent) is way more important than 
the ability to code. If you like coding I can suggest an ethical hacking and pen testing course that you can buy at Udemy. 
They cover many aspects of hacking in coding style (Python, networking, mapping, infrastructure): Learn Python & Ethical 
Hacking From Scratch | Udemy. If you want to implement security coding in software development there are Secure Coding
Guidelines (you may want to do your own research toward reliable source IEEE for example). ISO 9000-3: Quality management 
and quality assurance standards, https://www.iso.org/standard/26364.html. This is also a good book for your purpose. 
If you like them let me know.
